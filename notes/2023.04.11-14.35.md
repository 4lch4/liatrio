This is a meeting with Robert Dailey to prepare for my presentation/pitch meeting tomorrow.

- Most important part.
  - Be able to run it all from a single entrypoint.
  - No real _right_ answer. It can go in any various direction.
  - Doesn't _need_ intelligence/logic to determine if a step is necessary but it could be good brownie points.
- Potential things to discuss in demo.
  - What would it take to support other cloud providers?
  - What did I want to implement but couldn't due to time?
- Assert my assumptions on how it'll work and let folks know that's my path/plan.
- Document the assumption on AWS authentication.
  - There's no mention of the AWS access key id & secret access key.
  - What are other methods could I have used?
    - What would the next steps be?
- Find out what other options I have for authenticating with AWS.
  - The primary thing to remember is that I must talk about it.

- What could I have done to improve or expand?
- The CI pipeline is an optional extra
- Plan on the presentation being 15-20 minutes, just make sure to provide enough time for questions.
- Let folks know at the start how I prefer to field questions.
  - Can they interject as they have them?
  - Should they wait for the end?
  - Etc.
