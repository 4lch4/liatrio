# Dry run w/ Robert

I had a dry-run of my presentation with Robert Dailey and he provided a plethora of knowledge and input on what I have so far.

## Meeting Notes

The following are notes I jotted down during my discussion with Robert.

- Potentially move the objectives & reasoning towards the end?
- Focus on the IaaC and app.
  - Implement a one-click solution?
- Using IaaC?
- I chose AWS, why did I do so?
  - I chose it because it's the biggest industry standard.
  - Felt like the most valuable to learn as I'm the least familiar with it.
- I should focus more on selling myself as an engineer as opposed to the app/system for a client.
- Why did I make the decisions I made?
- Outline the things I missed and would've done next?
- If time was infinite, what would I have done next?
- Move my 3rd slide to the end?
- Delete the 2nd slide?
- Potentially 3 slides?
  - Intro slide.
- A slide on the challenges I faced.
  - What'd I do to get around those?
  - The Kubernetes manifest.
    - Why would I want it?
    - What'd I do in the interim that made it deployable for the time being?
- Keep in mind that they don't expect us to finish 100% of the project.
- A slide of accomplishments & next steps.
  - What I would've liked to do with more time.
  - Treat it as if I was going to do more after the interview process.
- A slide on my top problem areas.
  - Mitigated problems. Things I ran into and how I fixed them.
  - Problems I wasn't able to fix.
- Then leave it open for questions.
- Don't forget to demo the stuff working!!
  - Potentially do that at the start.
  - Building the EKS cluster is likely to take 15-20 minutes.
- Gauge roughly how long each slide will take.
  - Make sure to plan for what to do if things go too fast or too slow.
- Make sure to start the EKS build before kicking off the presentation!
- What was I most passionate about?
- Don't be afraid to walk through the AWS UI if that's my thing.
  - Most likely not.
